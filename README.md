SEC Corporate Filing Insights

The Financial Statement Data Set is a comprehensive resource created by the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate the analysis and consumption of financial data 
submitted by public companies. This dataset is derived from the EX-101 attachments to various 
filings, which utilize the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) to present structured 
financial information. 

Key Features of the Dataset 

The dataset includes quarterly and annual numeric data from primary financial statements, 
which encompass: 

● Balance Sheet 
● Income Statement 
● Cash Flow Statement 
● Changes in Equity 
● Comprehensive Income 

The dataset consists of four key components: 

1. Submission Data Set (SUB): Contains records for each XBRL submission, providing 
essential information about the filing entity and the submission itself.

2. Number Data Set (NUM): Includes individual numeric values reported in the primary 
financial statements, detailing every line item from each submission.

3. Tag Data Set (TAG): Provides metadata about the tags used in the submissions, 
including documentation labels, taxonomy versions, and tag attributes.

4. Presentation Data Set (PRE): Offers insights into how tags and corresponding numbers 
were presented in the financial statements, including their sequence and structure.
